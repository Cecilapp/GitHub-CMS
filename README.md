# GitHub CMS

Use GitHub Issues as a CMS for a [Cecil](https://cecil.app) blog.

## Usage

1. Create a new [issue](https://github.com/Cecilapp/github-cms/issues/new) and write a blog post (_title_ + _body_)
2. Publish it with the label `published`
3. Wait few seconds for [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/Cecilapp/github-cms/actions) to publish it on the [GitHub Pages website](https://cecilapp.github.io/github-cms/)
